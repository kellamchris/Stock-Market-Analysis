I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help me with the inital code for looping through each worksheet to output the correct data in the correct column. 
I also used it to help me calculate the percentage change.
I referred a lot to the "credit card checker" solution code from Module 2 Class 3 Activities. 
Also used Xpert for what formula to use for finding the max value and min value and putting them into another table on the side.
Used ChatGPT to help me with finding the corresponding ticker for the max and min value and putting it into the table as well.
Ran my code through ChatGPT to find out why it wasn't working for each worksheet, and made the correct adjustments.
Everything was working, but my calculcation for the stock changes were different than the solution images in the assignment. I realized I had "closePrice" as the closing price in the first row of each stock, not the close price of the last day of the quarter. I used ChatGPT to help me adjust my code to have closePrice be the correct cell.
