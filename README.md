**Christopher Kellam**  

**Languages and Tools Used in the Project:**  
- **Language:** VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)  
- **Tool:** Microsoft Excel  

## **Project Overview**  
This project utilized VBA scripting to analyze quarterly stock market data, automating calculations and generating insights into ticker performance. The script processes stock data to calculate quarterly changes, percentage changes, total stock volume, and highlights key metrics such as the greatest percentage increase, percentage decrease, and total volume.  

The features include:  
- Loops through stock data across all worksheets.  
- Outputs key metrics for each ticker symbol.  
- Applies conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes.  
- Dynamically processes multiple worksheets with a single script.
